A small script that organizes your (backed up) tv-series.

Intended usage:

./move-series -d <my_series_directory> -s <my_incoming_directory>

The script right now first scans the destination directory and stores all
directory names. It then tries to match that name with the names of the
series in your incoming name. It also optionally tries to figure out what
season it belongs to. Then it moves the series from the incoming directory
to the permanent place.

This is still a very early versions with a lot on the todo list:

* create new directories for series that doesn't match anything
* add the subtitle code (base it on periscope?)
* improve the regular expression for seasons matching, currently only
  handling series that are named <series>.sXXeYY
* create a config file so that you don't have to configure it from the cli
* make it run from transmission-bt
